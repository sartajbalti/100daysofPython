# Indentation
# always keep a watch on the indentation while coding in python 
# Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
# Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
# Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

# If you do not indent the code inside the function, you will get an error.

# The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, but it has to be at least one.

# while loop 
# while loop is used to execute a block of code multiple times
# while loop is used to iterate over a block of code as long as the test expression(condition) is true
# while loop is used when we don't know the number of iterations in advance
# while loop is used when we need to execute a set of statements as long as the condition is true
# while loop is used when we need to execute a set of statements infinite times
